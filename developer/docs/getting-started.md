# Getting Started

To get started with the Agendas API, you'll need an Agendas account. If you don't have one, you can [register for Agendas](https://app.agendas.co/).

**_NOTE_** We often refer to integrations developed with the Agendas API as *apps*.

## The Developer Console

To make and edit integrations with the API, you'll use the developer console. There are 3 ways to access it:
* **The boring but easy way.** [Go directly to the developer console.](https://app.agendas.co/#/console)
* **The slightly secretive way.** Go to [Agenda's settings](https://app.agendas.co/#/settings/about), click on the *Credits* tab, then click each item once.
* **The JS console way.** Go to any page within [Agendas](https://app.agendas.co), open your browser's JavaScript console, then run the function `setHackingSkills`.

Once you're done, go to the [settings page](https://app.agendas.co/#/settings) and click on the General tab. You should notice a new switch reading *Show developer console*. Turn it on to enable the developer console.

A link to the developer console should appear in the sidebar below settings but above your agendas. Click on it to enter the developer console.

## Creating your first app
Here's how to create your first app:
1. Head to the [developer console](https://app.agendas.co/#/console) and click the blue *Get Started* button
2. Type in the name of your new app (don't worry, you can change it later)
3. Your new app will be created and a client ID generated. Once you're redirected onto your new app's settings, feel free to start coding away!
